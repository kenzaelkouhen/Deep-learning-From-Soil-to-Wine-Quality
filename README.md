# Deep-learning-From-Soil-to-Wine-Quality

The project employs a Big Data approach by collecting and analyzing (private) laboratory chemical data. Its primary objective is to leverage this dataset for informed decision-making during the harvesting phase. By utilizing data gathered from three critical stages in grape growth, the project applies regression models for predictive analytics. 

This, in turn, aids winegrowers in proactively addressing issues like potassium chlorosis and nitrogen deficiency, ultimately enhancing the quality and yield of their harvests.
